/*
  Coroutines.h - Library providing a simple coroutine system.
  Created by Renaud BÃ©dard with code review help by Bryan McConkey and zerozshadow, July 18th, 2014.
  Released into the public domain.
  Version 1.0.

  The variant of coroutines proposed in this library are inspired by Unity coroutines
  http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Coroutine.html

  The basic idea is to be able to create blocks of code that execute sequentially,
  but can choose to stop temporarily and resume later. This is similar to threads,
  but in the case of coroutines, they never get pre-empted and will only give away
  focus if they explicitely yield.

  The library provides a coroutine manager that pre-allocates and updates coroutines,
  as well as provides wait, suspend and resume constructs to make their usage more
  convenient.

  A simple coroutine is declared like this :

    // flashes a LED attached to analog pin 5 for 100ms
    void flashOnce(COROUTINE_CONTEXT(coroutine))
    {
        BEGIN_COROUTINE;

        analogWrite(5, 255);

        coroutine.wait(100);
        COROUTINE_YIELD;

        analogWrite(5, 0);

        END_COROUTINE;
    }

  Here, the "wait" call adds 100ms to the timer that will prevent the coroutine from
  resuming on the next update. The COROUTINE_YIELD macro exits the function, and
  records the state of the coroutine so it can be resumed later. The BEGIN and END
  macros do the rest required for this to work.

  The COROUTINE_CONTEXT() macro defines the name of the context argument to the
  coroutine, which has the type Coroutine& (a reference type). You may not use a
  regular parameter definition, since the coroutine needs to know the name you choose
  for it, and using this macro was the most straightforward way.

  You may also use "coroutine locals", which are variables local to the coroutine
  and whose state will be preserved after a yield and recovered when resuming :

    void flashThrice(COROUTINE_CONTEXT(coroutine))
    {
        COROUTINE_LOCAL(int, i);

        BEGIN_COROUTINE;

        for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
        {
            analogWrite(5, 255);

            coroutine.wait(100);
            COROUTINE_YIELD;

            analogWrite(5, 0);

            coroutine.wait(50);
            COROUTINE_YIELD;
        }

        END_COROUTINE;
    }

  Notice that the for(;;) loop does not declare "i" since it already has been.
  However, its value is undefined, like any other variable, until it's first set.
  Since it's declared as COROUTINE_LOCAL, after returning from the YIELD, its
  value will be restored to what it was prior to yielding.
  COROUTINE_LOCAL declarations must be done before BEGIN_COROUTINE.
  Coroutine locals live on the heap, so their size must be kept in check. Also,
  there is a maximum amount of them which defaults to 8, but can be tweaked in
  this header. (see Coroutine::MaxLocals)

  Coroutines may also loop instead of evaluate once, using the loop() function :

    void flashForever(COROUTINE_CONTEXT(coroutine))
    {
        BEGIN_COROUTINE;

        analogWrite(5, 255);

        coroutine.wait(100);
        COROUTINE_YIELD;

        analogWrite(5, 0);

        coroutine.wait(50);
        COROUTINE_YIELD;

        coroutine.loop();

        END_COROUTINE;
    }

  If the loop() function is not called in one of its iterations, the loop stops and
  the coroutine will end its execution normally.

  There are some preconditions that the sketch must meet to use coroutines :
  1. Declare a Coroutines<N> object, where N is the number of preallocated coroutines
     required; in other words, the number of coroutines you expect your program to 
     "concurrently" run.
  2. In your loop() function, call the update() function on that Coroutines<N> object.
  
  Declared coroutines will not be started automatically. The sketch needs to start
  them with a function call :

    // where "coroutines" is a Coroutine<N> instance,
    // and "flashOnce" is the name of a declared coroutine
    coroutines.start(flashOnce);

  This fires the coroutine, which will begin in the next update.
  The return type of the function must be void, and it must be defined with the
  COROUTINE_CONTEXT() macro as only parameter.

  You can keep a reference to the coroutine object via the return value of "start", 
  but since these objects are recycled, one must be careful to only use the reference
  while the coroutine it initially referred to is still alive.
  One way to do this would be to declare the coroutine reference as a pointer in the
  sketch's file-scope variables, and set it to NULL right before COROUTINE_END.

  If the sketch holds a reference or a pointer to a coroutine object, it can manipulate
  its execution from the outside using these functions :

  - suspend() will prevent any subsequent update to the coroutine
  - resume() reverts a suspended coroutine and allows it to execute in the next update
  - terminate() makes the coroutine prematurely exit in the next update

  The suspend() function may also be called from within a coroutine, which blocks
  its execution until resume() is called on it from the sketch.

  To let a coroutine clean up after an external termination, you can use the
  COROUTINE_FINALLY macro like this :

    void finallyExample(COROUTINE_CONTEXT(coroutine))
    {
        BEGIN_COROUTINE;

        coroutine.wait(1000);
        COROUTINE_YIELD;

        Serial.println("Waited 1000ms");

        COROUTINE_FINALLY
        {
            Serial.println("Exiting...");
        }

        END_COROUTINE;
    }

  In this example, the "Exiting..." string will be printed whether the coroutine
  is externally terminated or if it finished execution normally, after waiting 1000ms.
  The "Waited 1000ms" string however will only be printed if the coroutine stays
  alive for more than 1000ms.
  If used, the COROUTINE_FINALLY block must be placed before END_COROUTINE.

  There is currently no way to return something from a coroutine or to pass a parameter
  to a coroutine. However, they have access to the sketch's file-scope variables,
  which can be used for input and/or output.

  The library comes with debug-logging ability, which can be enabled by defining
  three macros :

  - trace(...)
  - assert(condition, ...)
  - P(string_literal)

  See their default definition below for how they need to be implemented.

  This coroutine implementation is based on Simon Tatham's
